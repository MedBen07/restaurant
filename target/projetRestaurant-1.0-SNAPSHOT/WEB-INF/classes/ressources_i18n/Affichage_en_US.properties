texte1 = This cozy house located close to the Montreal Science Center offers an undeniable charm. Its colonial decoration and its chic setting give it a cozy and cozy atmosphere particularly appreciated by a demanding clientele. Assisted in the dining room by her charming partner Léandre, Clémentine Matuvu offers a very personal cuisine. Chef of an insatiable curiosity, she revisits her classics with talent and does not hesitate to think outside the box while respecting the seasons and their products with the market as a source of inspiration. Very pleasant garden in season.
texte2 = One of the oldest buildings in the city in... rue Neuve, you can't make it up! The chef, passionate about her profession and wine, plays the "bistronomy" card to the fullest, betting on very good quality market products. A delight... like the summer terrace.
